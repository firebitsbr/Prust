# Daily logs
A log to write the activities and the tasks done each day in the Prust project.
### 13.07.2020 Monday
Read the *Rust Programming Language* documentation to create a simple program.  
Read *Ccsds 133.0-B-2* to comply the header standards. The first goal is to create 
an echo application in Rust (without complying to the standards for now).
### 15.07.2020 Wednesday
Done some debugging with the practice branch. Created an application that connects to the 127.0.0.1:5000 address via TCP.
### 16.07.2020 Thursday
Learning about creating a socket and establishing a connection with a custom protocol. Will read the standards to create a TM data structure.
### 17.07.2020 Friday
Learned futures of structs and modules to create an encapsulated packet data structure.
### 20.07.2020 Monday
Learned about references and patterns. Still have to make a decision about the hierarchical structure.
### 24.07.2020 Friday
Created a module called headers and made a struct called "PrimaryHeader" and implemented its constructor which will have byte array and returns the struct.
Later parameter checks should be done for the constructor. A method for the struct PrimaryHeader is also defined but currently acts as a stub function.
