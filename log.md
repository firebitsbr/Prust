# Daily logs
A log to write the activities and the tasks done each day in the Prust project.
### 13.07.2020 Monday
Read the *Rust Programming Language* documentation to create a simple program.  
Read *Ccsds 133.0-B-2* to comply the header standarts. The first goal is to create 
an echo application in Rust (without complying to the standarts for now).
