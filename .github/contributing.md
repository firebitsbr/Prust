# Contributing

Welcome to the Prust project!

Weâ€™re very glad you want to join our community who have contributed code to Prust repositories in GitHub.

Before contributing to Prust:

 - Read the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) - there is no Contribution License Agreement (CLA)
 - Dig into CONTRIBUTING.MD, which covers submitting bugs, requesting new features, preparing your code for a pull request, etc.
 - Always strive to collaborate with mutual respect.
 - Not sure what to work on? We've got some ideas.

We look forward to seeing your pull requests!

## Git commit

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below [Agreement](#agreement).

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:
```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

The text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either `-s` or `--signoff` to your usual [git-commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) commands.


## Agreement

The __[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/)__ is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
